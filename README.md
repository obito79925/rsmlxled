The ultrasonic ranging module emits ultrasonic signals to the outside at regular intervals for distance measurement. When the system detects that someone is approaching, it generates an enable signal to control the infrared temperature measurement module to work. The infrared temperature measurement module reads the data in the infrared temperature measurement sensor through the I2C protocol, and sends it to the digital tube to display the human body temperature in real time. When the human body temperature is lower than 37 degrees Celsius, the sound and light alarm module displays a green light, indicating that the temperature is normal, and it is allowed to pass; when the human body temperature exceeds 37 degrees Celsius, the sound and light alarm module displays a flashing red light, indicating that the temperature is abnormal and it is not allowed to pass. The serial port display module uploads the measured temperature each time a pedestrian passes to the PC to save the recorded temperature data.
